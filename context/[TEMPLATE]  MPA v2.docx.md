**MULTISIGNATURE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT**

**(“Agreement”)**

between

\[Association Name\], an association incorporated in Zug, Switzerland 

(“**Association**”)

And

\[Active Signer  Personal Name\], \[Citizenship\], residing in \[Residence Country\] 

/

\[Active Signer Entity Name\], incorporated in (Incorporation City, Incorporation Country\]

(“**Active Signer**”)

(Each a “**Party**”, collectively the “**Parties**”)

**PREAMBLE**

**WHEREAS** the purpose of the Association is to orchestrate collaboration and provide operational support for teams building technological public goods.

**WHEREAS** the Association holds, among other assets, an operational budget dedicated for the development of specific public goods which it manages in line with its purpose ("**Designated Ops Budget**"). 

**WHEREAS** the Association keeps the Designated Ops Budget in self-custody in the wallets listed under Exhibit 1 (“**Wallet**”). 

**WHEREAS** to ensure the secure storage and management of the Designated Ops Budget, the Association wishes to implement a multisignature scheme, requiring Wallet transactions to be approved by multiple members acting as designated signatories within the governance of the Association (“**Multisignature Scheme**”). 

**WHEREAS** the Active Signer is a member of the Association (“**Membe**r”) and is willing to act as a signer in the Multisignature Scheme. 

**WHEREAS** the Parties recognize the importance of ensuring that the Multisignature Scheme is managed securely, transparently, and effectively. This Agreement establishes the framework, responsibilities, and processes to govern the coordination and operation of the Wallet(s), ensuring compliance with the Association's purpose and applicable laws.

**NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the Preamble, the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

1. **ASSOCIATION WALLET** 

The Designated Ops Budget is held in the Wallet governed by the Multisignature Scheme outlined in Exhibit 2. 

If the event that multiple addresses are associated with the Wallet, Exhibit 2 shall detail any deviations to the Multisignature Scheme where such deviations apply to a specific Wallet. 

The Wallet shall be used exclusively for Designated Ops Budget funds and shall not store any unrelated assets.  The Active Signer shall not accept any funds into the Wallet for their own account or the account of third parties.

The Wallet and the related assets held in the Wallet are the property of the Association and remains under its exclusive control. The Active Signer holds no rights, title, or personal interest in any assets stored therein by virtue of this Agreement.

By joining the Multisignature Scheme, the Active Signer neither receives nor holds funds on behalf of the Association and does not act in a fiduciary capacity.

The Association may create additional Wallets to the Multisignature Scheme. In this case, the Parties shall amend Exhibit 1 accordingly. 

2. **ACTIVE SIGNER ROLE** 

By executing this Agreement, the Active Signer:

(i)	Accepts their role as a participant to the Multisignature Scheme;  
(ii)	Accepts to be entrusted with a Key; and  
(iii)	Agrees to receive and process Signature Requests.

Through participation in the Multisignature Scheme, the Active Signer does not gain any additional decision-making authority beyond their role as a Member. Instead, the Active Signer serves a purely technical function within the Association, without control or disposal rights over the Designated Ops Budget or Wallet(s). 

The role of the Active Signer is limited to executing transactions in line with the process outline in Exhibit 2, on behalf of and in the name of the Association, and strictly in accordance with validly adopted decisions approved by the Members and  Accordingly, the Active Signer is responsible for the orderly administration of the Wallet and the proper deployment of the Designated Ops Budget in alignment with the Association’s decisions.

The role of Active Signer is strictly personal and cannot be delegated, assigned, or otherwise transferred to any third party. The Active Signer shall not execute this Agreement on behalf of any third party. Furthermore, the Key must not be shared, disclosed, or made accessible to anyone other than the designated Active Signer.

The role as an Active Signer is performed as a Member of the Association. The Active Signer receives no compensation and is not entitled to reimbursement of expenses.

3. **MULTISIGNATURE SCHEME** 

Any Active Signer may initiate a message disseminated to the remaining participants in the Multisignature Scheme and requesting them to sign a transaction with their Key (“**Signature Request**”). 

The Association ensures that the Multisignature Scheme is set up in a manner which allows transactions to be executed without the participation of the Active Signer necessarily responding to each Signature Request. 

Signature Requests shall be initiated and responded to in accordance with this Section, the details provided under Exhibit 2 as well as any other procedures and guidelines set forth by the Association, as listed under Exhibit 3 (“**Internal Policies**”). 

Active Signers shall not intentionally refrain from responding to a Signature Request, unless there are valid grounds to contest it. In such cases, they must promptly communicate these grounds to all other Active Signers.

4. **OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACTIVE SIGNERS**

   1. **General** 

Active Signers shall perform their duties with due diligence, care, and professionalism, and shall act honestly, ethically, and in good faith, free from personal bias or conflict of interest, in all aspects of their role.

2. **Critical Review and Reporting**

Active Signers must critically review each Signature Request before approving it, ensuring that it aligns with the decisions of the Association and the decision itself aligns with the defined governance process.

If any concerns arise about a proposed transaction, Active Signers are obligated to immediately report it to other Active Signers and provide all relevant information regarding their concerns.

3. **Collaboration** 

Active Signers must maintain open lines of communication with each other, ensuring transparency. This includes sharing relevant information regarding the status of a Signature Request or any issues encountered.

Beyond the consultation or collaboration expressly required under this Agreement, the Parties are expected to engage in proactive, prompt, frequent, and timely consultation and cooperation on all matters related to the Multisignature Scheme and the Wallet, ensuring that all decisions, transactions, and actions taken are well-informed and aligned with the best interests of the Association.

4. **Security of the Key**

The Active Signer is solely responsible for the secure storage and protection of their assigned Key. The Key must be stored in a secure manner that prevents unauthorized access, loss, theft, or compromise. The Active Signer must take all necessary precautions to protect the security of the Key and by extension, of the Wallet. The Active Signer acknowledges the security guidelines in Exhibit 2 and shall strictly comply therewith, as these may be amended by the Association at any time.

The Active Signer shall participate in any security procedures mandated by the Association to ensure the security of the Wallet and the Multisignature Scheme, such as participation in regular testing. 

In the event of a suspected or actual compromise, loss, or theft of a Key, or any detected suspicious or irregular activity related to the Multisignature Scheme, Wallet, transactions, or decision-making process, the Active Signer shall immediately notify the Association and all other Active Signers in writing. The notification must detail the incident and any risk mitigation measures taken. If necessary, the notification shall also be forwarded to the appropriate authorities.

Any effective loss or unauthorized access or compromise of a Key results in the automatic de-permission of the concerned Key and termination of this Agreement with the concerned Active Signer, to be replaced by a new one within seven (7) calendar days.

5. **Availability** 

In cases of inability to perform their duties, Active Signers must notify the other Active Signers immediately, when possible, and ensure that a clear plan is in place to guarantee that their duties can be fulfilled without interruption.

Active Signers must avoid being unavailable, i.e., without network access or means of communication, for more than \[X days/hours\] without prior notification, unless such unavailability results from unforeseeable circumstances, such as force majeure or illness. 

5. **CONFIDENTIALITY**

Active Signers shall not disclose their role, the existence of the Multisignature Scheme nor its details to any third Parties. Active Signers shall besides maintain the confidentiality of all sensitive information related to the transactions, decisions, and financial matters of the Association. 

Disclosure of such information should only be made when required by law or in the course of their duties.

The Active Signer has the right to remain anonymous towards third parties and not disclosed as a participant of the Multisignature Scheme. 

In such cases, discussions and communications involving the Active Signer referring to the identity or elements allowing the identification of the Active Signer shall be conspicuously marked as "confidential" and shall be deemed "Confidential Information". 

The Association shall maintain the confidentiality of, and shall not disclose, publish or make available, all Confidential Information: provided, however, that the foregoing covenants shall not apply to particular Confidential Information to the extent that: (a) such Confidential Information becomes widely known to the public (other than through a breach of this Agreement); (b) such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed pursuant to the applicable laws or regulations or orders of the court or other government authorities applicable to the Association (provided that the Association provides the Active Signer with written notice sufficiently in advance of such disclosure to afford such Parties the other opportunity to seek a protective order or otherwise limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information); or (c) such Confidential Information is disclosed by the Association to its legal counsels or financial advisors with a need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide advice regarding the transactions contemplated hereunder, provided that such legal counsels or financial advisors, as the case may be, are apprised of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and are bound by the confidentiality obligations to the Association with respect thereto similar to those set forth in this section. 

This section shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. 

Notwithstanding the above, any Active Signer may, for themselves only (and assuming all risks that may arise from such disclosure), make public their status as an Active Signer, but not the existence, terms, or conditions of this Agreement.

9. **CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

The Active Signer shall continuously monitor and evaluate their own personal facts and circumstances (including a direct and indirect business and other economic interests in the Designated Ops Budget) that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a material conflict of interest in connection with the Active Signer’s performance of their role and duties under this Agreement.

1. **Ongoing Conflicts of Interest**

If the Active Signer becomes aware of an ongoing material conflict of interest with respect to the execution of their respective role hereunder, the Active Signer shall promptly resign or otherwise be removed from participation in their role in accordance with the provisions contained herein, unless such conflict of interest has been disclosed to the Association and other participants to the Multisignature Scheme in reasonable detail, and a majority of the Association consented to retaining their role as Active Signer notwithstanding such conflict of interest (which consent, for the avoidance of doubt, may be conditioned on appropriate disclosure to defined parties). 

2.  **One-Off Conflicts of Interest.** 

If the Active Signer becomes aware of a material conflict of interest with respect to any specific Signature Request, the Active Signer shall promptly disclose such conflict of interest to the Association and other participants to the Multisignature Scheme and refrain from further involvement with such Signature Request. 

10. **MISCELLANEOUS**

   **EXHIBIT 1 – WALLET DESCRIPTION**

   1. **Description**

The Multisignature Scheme includes Number of Keys Keys, one of which is held by the Active Signer. \[Decision Quorum\] signatures out of the Number of Keys Keys (“**Decision Quorum**”) are required to execute a transaction with the Wallet. The Decision Quorum can be amended by decision of the Association. 

The Multisignature Scheme relies on the following signature platform (“\[**Multisignature Platform\]**”):

| \[Wallet Address\] \[Signature Platform\] |
| :---- |

**EXHIBIT 2 – MULTISIGNATURE SCHEME PROCESS**

\[\]

1. **Key Storage and Security**

Active Signers are encouraged to implement robust security practices to safeguard their Keys and prevent unauthorized access. 

Recognizing the diverse approaches to key management, Active Signers have the flexibility to choose between hot or cold storage solutions for their Keys. The use of new hot wallets is permitted. However, for security best practices, the reuse of old wallets is not allowed. 

Each Active Signer will create their own unique wallet and utilize the corresponding Keys. The specific method of key storage and security implementation is left to the discretion of the individual Active Signer, who is expected to exercise due diligence in selecting a secure solution that aligns with their technical capabilities and risk tolerance.

2. **Transaction** **Process**

\[\]

1. **Execution of a Decision**

Active Signers are made aware of decisions of the Association in their capacity as Members. If they have not taken part in a specific decision, \[…\]

If an adopted decision does not sufficiently define all parameters of the transaction to be executed, the participants to the Multisignature Scheme shall review it in their capacity as Members before proceeding with its execution. 

2. **Signature Request Initiation**

If the Association has not specifically designated someone in the relevant decision to prepare the transaction and initiate the Signature Request, the Active Signer may take the initiative to do so. In such a case, the Active Signer shall share the Signature Request with all other participants in the Multisignature Scheme, accompanied by a communication specifying which decision the transaction is executing.

Signature Requests will be made in English through the Multisignature Platform and include the following information for the accuracy of which the submitting Active Signer is responsible: 

* Token amount to be transferred 

* Token type to be transferred 

* Receiving address 

* Description of purpose for request (execution of association decision, agreement, invoice payment etc.)

The Active Signer must share the availability of the Signature Request on the Multisignature Platform with other participants of the Multisignature Scheme via the agreed private and secure communication as specified below (“**Channel**”).

| Private Channel (for association members only) Discord channel  |
| :---- |

3. **Signature Request Response**

The Active Signer is expected to monitor the Channel regularly and must have enabled alerts/notifications to ensure each new Signature Request is read as soon as possible. If the Active Signer is unable to access the Channel or the Multisignature Platform to review a Signature Request, they must immediately inform the other participants to the Multisignature Scheme by appropriate means, including the reason for their inability to access. 

The Active Signer shall decide whether to accept a Signature Request (i.e., to sign the relevant transaction message with the Key for broadcast to and processing on the relevant blockchain network) or reject it (i.e., refuse the relevant transaction message with the Key, thereby blocking it from further processing) within 48 hours from the receipt of a Signature Request, unless otherwise agreed in writing. 

Upon receiving a Signature Request emitted by another participant of the Multisignature Scheme, the Active Signer must review its content to ensure it aligns with its intended purpose. This may include verifying the information against relevant external documents (e.g., invoices, agreements, etc.), and must always include a review of all transaction-related addresses (i.e. recipient addresses or smart contract addresses) using *Diffchecker* (available at https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/) or similar. 

If the Active Signer identifies any mistake, they must flag them on the Channel and recommend that the Signature Request be re-submitted on the Multisignature Platform. In such cases, the response deadline for the Signature Request is automatically extended by the time reasonably required to identify the correct information, re-enter the Signature Request and review the corrected Signature Request.

If necessary, the participant to the Multisignature Scheme may coordinate via the Channel, ask any relevant questions, and are expected to respond within a maximum of 24 hours. They should maintain open communication and a spirit of cooperation to foster positive relations with other Active Signers. When coordination is initiated, the Signature Request response deadline is extended by an additional 24 hours from the time the coordination request is posted on the Channel.

In the event of a dispute regarding the content of the Signature Request, the concerns raised by a participant to the Multisignature Scheme must be documented, analyzed, and discussed among all parties involved during the time deemed necessary but no longer than 72 hours. A Signature Request may be then approved if the Decision Quorum is reached, despite the presence of a dispute. 

4. **Transaction Failure**

In the event a signature request was approved but the transaction did not go through due to technical issues, the process outlined hereabove shall be repeated.

5. **Recipient Confirmation** 

After the approved Signature Request has resulted in a successful transaction broadcasted to the relevant blockchain, the Participant of the Multisignature Scheme who initiated the Signature Request shall request a receipt confirmation from the recipient and share it on the Channel.

**3\. Amendment**

Once the Designated Ops Budget has been committed to the Wallet, the Parties shall not approve or cooperate with any replacement or modification of the Decision Quorum or the Multisignature Scheme except 

1) solely to the extent necessary to protect against a clear and present security threat; or  
2) to facilitate removals, resignations and to fill vacancies. 

Subject to the foregoing limitations, the terms of this Exhibit shall be amended, supplemented, terminated or waived with the written consent of the majority of Active Signers. 

**4\. Vacancy**

In the event of a vacancy that does not affect the ability to reach the Decision Quorum, the vacancy shall be remedied by the admission of a new Member within twenty (20) calendar days from the date the vacancy arises. A new Agreement shall be executed with the incoming Member as soon as reasonably practicable.

If a vacancy renders the Decision Quorum unachievable, this Agreement shall be deemed automatically terminated with respect to the remaining Participants in the Multisignature Scheme.

In such case of termination, control of the Wallet shall be temporarily attributed to a designated Member, as agreed by the remaining Members prior to termination, solely for the purpose of safeguarding assets and facilitating the transition to a new multisignature scheme. This designated Member shall not make any transactions from the Wallet except as expressly authorized by a duly adopted decision of the Association.

3. **Amendment**

Once the Designated Ops Budget has been committed to the Wallet, the Parties shall not approve or cooperate with any replacement or modification of the Decision Quorum or the Multisignature Scheme except 

3) solely to the extent necessary to protect against a clear and present security threat; or  
4) to facilitate removals, resignations and to fill vacancies. 

Subject to the foregoing limitations, the terms of this Exhibit shall be amended, supplemented, terminated or waived with the written consent of the majority of Active Signers.
