Pricing and Service Group Structure
Pricing Definition: Pricing should be removed from the individual service level and defined entirely on the service group level.
Cost Components: The service group pricing must include both one-time costs and recurring costs.
Billing Cycle Discounts: Pricing should be defined on the service group level per tier and per billing cycle option (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual) to define discounts.
One-Time Costs: One-time setup costs are separate and apply independently, while only one recurring option applies based on the selected billing cycle.
Metrics Structure: The current metrics setup (name, unit, reset cycle, free budget, and absolute usage limit) is confirmed to be correct. The billing cycle for the service group is inherited by the metrics.
