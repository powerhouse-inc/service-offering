Subscription Summary Requirements (achra)

(Content & UI)
Content Focus: The summary should clearly summarize the operator, product name, price, and selected configuration details (tiers, add-ons) but generally exclude metrics.
Pricing in Summary: Pricing matters, including metric-based pricing.
Conciseness: Minimize the display of individual services, perhaps making them expandable, and group all costs at the service group level.
Summary Structure for Payment:
Display Setup Costs (one-time costs from all service groups, excluding metrics) as the immediate payment.
Display Recurring Costs (service group recurring costs, metric recurring costs, and metric setup costs that occur after the subscription starts).
Metric Detail Display: Use comment-like features or information icons for granular metric details (like absolute limits) to prevent overwhelming the user, while still showing relevant pricing information (free allowances, per-unit costs).
The summary should clearly detail the operator, product name, price, and selected configuration (tiers, add-ons).
Metrics should generally be excluded from the high-level summary to keep it concise.
Minimize the display of individual services and group everything at the service group level.
Use comment-like features or information icons for granular metric details (like absolute limits), while clearly showing free allowances and per-unit overage costs.
The summary should clearly split the costs into two parts: 1) Setup Costs (one-time costs, excluding metrics) as the immediate payment, and 2) Recurring Costs (service group recurring, metric recurring, and metric setup costs that occur after subscription starts).

Exclude Metric Details: Metrics themselves (like usage numbers) should generally be excluded from the high-level subscription summary to keep it concise and user-friendly.
Include Metric Pricing: Pricing related to metrics should still be shown.
Detail Presentation: To prevent overwhelming the user, full metric details like absolute usage limits should be presented using comment-like features or information icons. The relevant pricing information, such as free allowances and per-unit overage costs, should remain visible.
