❯ SO-Q1 so pricing moves to service group but we still have tier pricing, so there are as many "core services" pricings at the group level as there are tiers, reccuring pricing for the tier is a calculated value based on the service group reccuring pricings.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  SO-Q2 I think you can find the answer to this above. Also implement discount optionality in the editor when a user selects e.g. annual cycle a discount is applied: not sure                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  How Discounts are Applied and calcualted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  - it's 100 a month nd if if you buy for a year, we just set 1,200 minus 120,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  - The user should be able to select a billing cycle for the service group on the Acra platform to receive the corresponding discount.                                                                                                                                                            
  - this billing cycle choice should typically be applied globally across all service groups for the initial package purchase; so we need another option for the editor to be able to configure global discount (based on previous logic 1200 minus 120) for annual subscription, and users        
  should be able to select annual subscription on the tier level and its applied to all service groups.                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  SO-Q3 subscriptio instance service group gains a setup and a reccuring cost fields. yes, no more cost per individual services - this is true for instance and service offering doc model and editors.

  SO-Q6 this is a great question, standalone add-on should have - as a group - both recurring and setup options that can be true at the same time but not neccesarly true, it can have the options to connect the ad on group cost (recurring and setup) to the tiers, or it can be standalone     
  add on that has a fixed cost irrespective of the tier (this can be usefull for add ons that are introduced after an instance is operational)
